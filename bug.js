This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with a custom camera component. The issue arises when attempting to access the camera's preview before the component has fully mounted.  This leads to errors such as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'current')`. The problem is exacerbated when using asynchronous operations within the component's lifecycle methods (like `useEffect`).
