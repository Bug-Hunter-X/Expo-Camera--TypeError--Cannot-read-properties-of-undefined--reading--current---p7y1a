# Expo Camera Preview Error: 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'current')'

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API in conjunction with custom components. The error, `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'current')`, typically arises when trying to access the camera preview before the component has completely mounted. This example showcases the issue and provides a solution to prevent it.

## Problem

The issue occurs because asynchronous operations within component lifecycle methods (like `useEffect`) might attempt to access the camera reference before it's initialized.  This often happens when the component renders quickly before the camera has a chance to fully mount.

## Solution

The provided solution utilizes a `ref` to track the camera component's mounting status and uses a conditional rendering to ensure the preview is accessed only after the camera is ready. This ensures that the code accessing the camera preview only executes when the camera is correctly initialized and mounted, preventing undefined read errors.
